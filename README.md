## A Breif Overview of the Project 

Dynamic Pricing Models for Parking Lots with Real-Time Simulation
This project simulates dynamic pricing for urban parking spaces for 14 urban parking lots to improve their utilization. 
using real time real time data streams ,Pathway(for streaming),and Bokeh(for visualization).
Our main goal is to build a pricing engine that adjusts parking fees in real-time based on a variety of factors.

Objective: Develop a pricing model that updates a base price of $10 in real-time. The price changes should be smooth and explainable,
Methodology: You are required to build three models from scratch using only Python, Pandas, and Numpy

The Models:
Baseline Linear Model: A simple starting point where the price increases linearly with the parking lot's occupancy.
Demand-Based Model: A more advanced model where you create a demand function based on occupancy, queue length, traffic, and other features to set the price.
Competitive Pricing Model (Optional): An advanced model that incorporates the prices of nearby competitor parking lots, determined by their geographic location.
these models caluculates prices based on demand , occupancy, traffic, and nearby competitors
